## Swan Consulting Group Project

This group project was for a fictitious company called Swan Consulting, where we (as data consultants) would have to analyse Swan's fictitious data and see where customers are churning and find out why. Multiple methods are used throughout this data analysis, using Python, we explored the data, cleaned it via removal of null values, and applied logistic regression and decision trees models on the data to find out and also predict whether customers would churn or not.
